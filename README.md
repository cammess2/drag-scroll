# Drag Scroll

[![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/emreyolcu/drag-scroll/total.svg)](https://github.com/emreyolcu/drag-scroll/releases)

This small utility provides a toggleable drag-to-scroll mechanism for macOS.
It is especially useful with a trackball
where you can press mouse button 4 and roll the ball
to scroll through a large website or a document.

## Supported versions

As of April 2024, this utility works on macOS versions 10.9â€“14.0.

## Installation

You may download the binary [here](https://github.com/emreyolcu/drag-scroll/releases/download/v0.1.0/DragScroll.zip).
It runs in the background and does not interfere until mouse button 4 is pressed.
If you want it to run automatically at boot, do the following:

1. On macOS 13.0 and later, go to `System Settings > General > Login Items`;
otherwise, go to `System Preferences > Users & Groups > Login Items`.
2. Add `DragScroll` to the list.

If you want to undo the effect you may launch Activity Monitor,
search for `DragScroll` and force it to quit.

## Potential problems

Recent versions of macOS have made it difficult to run unsigned binaries.
If you experience issues launching the application
or if you can launch it but it has no effect on scrolling, try the following:

- Remove the quarantine attribute by running the command
`xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /path/to/DragScroll.app`,
where the path points to the application bundle.
- Disable Gatekeeper by running the command
`spctl --add /path/to/DragScroll.app`,
where the path points to the application bundle.
- Grant access to accessibility features:
  1. On macOS 13.0 and later, go to `System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility`;
  otherwise, go to `System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility`.
  2. Add `DragScroll` to the list.
